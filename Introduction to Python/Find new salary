'''An organization has decided to provide salary hike to its employees based on their job level. Employees can be in job levels 3 , 4 or 5. 
Hike percentage based on job levels are given below:

Job level     Hike Percentage (applicable on current salary)

3                     15

4                     7

5                     5

In case of invalid job level, consider hike percentage to be 0.

Given the current salary and job level, write a Python program to find and display the new salary of an employee'''

curr_salary = float(input("Enter the current salary of employee:"))
job_level = int(input("Enter the job level of employee:"))
if(job_level == 3):
    new_salary = curr_salary + (curr_salary * 15 / 100)
elif(job_level == 4):
    new_salary = curr_salary + (curr_salary * 7 / 100)
elif(job_level == 5):
    new_salary = curr_salary + (curr_salary * 5 / 100)
else:
    new_salary = curr_salary
print("The new salary is:",new_salary)
